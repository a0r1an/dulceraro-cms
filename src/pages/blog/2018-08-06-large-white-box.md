Our story takes place in a rather meaningless town called Mondane. A town that always seemed to have a tinge of grey to it. This wasn’t a town where color did not exist; instead, it was a town that chose not to let color exist. It was almost as if the town was always covered by clouds. The walls of the buildings were grey, the roads a deep dark grey, the houses a shade darker than white. The lack of color throughout the town of Mondane resembled the city’s inhabitants. The citizens of Mondane are a peculiar bunch. They like to keep to themselves. You are hard pressed to ever see two people talk to each other in public, and if you did, it was a common consensus that you turned away because one shouldn’t be meddling in anyone's business. At least, that’s what my mom taught me. My mom taught me a lot of things, or should I say tried to teach me a lot of things.

<br />

You see, she homeschooled me. Every kid in Mondane was homeschooled since we do not have a school of any kind. Beginning at the age of 5, every child was mailed a Book of Education. A book distributed by the town of Mondane to educate their children for the next 12 years. It contains the subject matter, the homework, and the answers to the homework for the grades K - 12. I remember when the book arrived in the mail. I had been looking out the window from my living room for a solid 45 minutes. Not looking at anything in particular, just gazing out and hoping something interesting would happen. I got excited when cars passed by my house, but no car had passed as of yet. It was a hot day as most days are in Mondane. The fan was blowing thick, hot air at me, but it was better than nothing. My hair waved back and forth in front of my eyes, which entertained me for a bit. While looking at my dark black hair swing slowly from side to side less than an inch away from my eyes, I didn’t notice the grey van pull up in front of my house’s mailbox. I finally saw the van when the sound of my mailbox opening startled me. It was the mailman in his light grey uniform with long white socks and dark grey hat. The man was portly, and the bottom three buttons of his shirt were ready to blast off at dangerous speeds if he decided to make a sudden gesture. “The mailman is here!” I belted out to my mom who was making sandwiches for lunch in the kitchen. “Mom! The mailman is here!” This time, yelling in the direction of the kitchen, but still maintaining my sight on the mailman. I heard my mom let out a sigh that sounded as if she were in some sort of physical pain. I ignored her. Up until then, I can only remember the mailman coming to my house two other times. The mailman walked towards the van and opened the sliding passenger door. It got stuck less than halfway open, but after a couple of jerks, the door opened the whole way. Inside the van, you could see three or four large white boxes of the same size. The mailman lazily leaned over one of the boxes to read the label. He pushed it to the side forcefully and angrily. Couldn’t blame him, it was hot out, and I would have been just as mad working in this heat. He leaned over another box and read its label. Leaning off the box, he crouches down a bit and bear hugged it out of the van, knocking over one of the white boxes onto the street. He looked behind to see the damage, but continued walking towards our porch with a face that looked like he was going to quit his job right after dropping off the box. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. We were getting a package! A large one at that. Whatever was in that box, it would pull me out of this perpetuating boredom. The mailman threw the box in front of the door of my house, rang the doorbell, and turned around all in one motion, beginning to walk towards his van. “Who is it, Rey?” My mom said in an incurious tone. “I told you the mailman is here and he dropped a big white box!” I yelled while maneuvering like an acrobat to the front door. She peeked into the living room to see why I was making so much noise. When she saw me hop from one coach to the other almost halfway to the door, she gave out a yelp. “Rey! Don't you jump around like a monkey on the coaches. I have told you million times not to do that.” I paused in my tracks, still looking at the door. “Get down from there,” my mom barked. I climbed down. My mom wiped her hands off on her apron, leaving reddish orange streaks from the Tomato she was cutting. She calmly walked over to the door. 

<br />

Mom was in her late 50’s at this point in her life. She had short black and white hair that reached up to the back of her neck. Her hair pulled back and held in place by her thin plastic headband. Her face had hardly any wrinkles, which was impressive for that age, but it did lack something. Her bulbous eyes covered by her half-closed eyelids as if she was ready to fall asleep at a moment’s notice. She wore a white T-shirt and grey shorts that went up to her shins. She wore the same outfit almost every day. She had 7 pairs of the exact same outfit, and every year, she would get 7 new pairs of that outfit. She would say it’s because they had imperfections and stains, but it's also because my mom's waist grew a little bit each year. That's what happens when you get older as far as I can tell.

<br />

My mom unlocked the door and gently opened it. She let her lips form a small smile when she saw the box. She looked over at me, still smiling. “Looks like you got a surprise.” She says weakly. My eyes widen, and my teeth become visible from a mile away as I smile till my face hurts. As my mom drags in the box, I think to myself. “Am I dreaming?” I never got anything sent to me. More so, I never got a surprise in my life. It’s not my birthday, is it? This is better than my birthday. On my birthday I would get the same thing every year. The same dumb outfit. White button-up shirt and dark grey shorts. But this is different. This is a surprise! A box that can contain everything and anything. My mind was racing. I was in such a daydream that I didn’t notice my Mom has gone into the kitchen to get a knife. She slowly walked over to the box with the knife and began to carefully cut the tape that sealed the box. She opened the box and began to take out large pieces of filler paper. It seemed like it took hours for her to remove all of the filler. It must have been something very fragile and important, I thought to myself. As Mom reached in again to unearth whatever was in the box, her arm stopped suddenly, seeming to hit pay dirt. With one hand still in the box, she reached in with her other hand. It must be heavy. Starting to take mental notes of what it could and could not be. With her face scrunched up, she lifts the object out of the box using almost all of her force. The object was wrapped in a light brown parchment paper. She slowly walked over to the dinner table and set the large object on top of it. She took in a heavy breath and slowly let it out.

<br />

I was stuck to the floor beneath me, perplexed by the object on the table. I stared at it and didn’t realize my mom was calling me over to the table. “Rey, come over and open it.” I looked at her, and her eyes gave me a reassuring feeling. I walked over to the object and climbed up onto one of the dinner table's chairs. The parchment paper covering the object was thick. I looked up at my mom, and she quipped, “Well, you don't have all day, do you?” I looked back down at the object, a rectangular piece of mass waiting to be unwrapped. I start at the edge and begin to claw at it. I cut an opening and stuck my finger through it. With my finger still in the hole, I swiped across the object. I tore the remaining parchment, eagerness and sheer curiosity crawled through my body like a virus. There were tiny pieces of parchment everywhere, which I pushed to the side with a swipe of my arm. At that time, I didn’t know I was looking at an object that I would hate more than anything in this world. An object that would make me feel empty with just the thought of it. Empty as if there was no purpose of life. At that time, I saw a book. Its canvas texture was greyish blue with a dark grey leather binding. At that age, the book was half my size. A behemoth of a book. At that point in my life, I had only seen a couple of books. One was my mom's notebook, which was barely ever used. The other was a small phonebook that the city gave us. It only had about 20 pages in it.

<br />

Their were engraved letters written across the hardcover of the newly arrived book. Big silver foil serif letters each the size of my eyeball. I didn’t know how to read, but something about the letters did not look right. I looked over my shoulder and noticed my Mom was right behind me. I looked up at her, and her large circular eyes were beaming down at me. She was looking at me but not really looking at me, if that makes any sense. Her face, giving the expression of a memory just coming back to her. Half smiling, she whispered to me, “It's your Book of Education.” I looked back at the book. “What does it do?” I said with a bewildered tone. Mom moved over to the side of the dining table and sat gently on the nearest chair. Her smile faded, and her face grew suddenly serious. She reached over to me and caressed my chin. She took a deep breath. “This book will teach you everything you need to know. It will teach you how to read, about the world's history, how to do math and about the stars in the sky. When I was your age, I got the same book in the mail. That's where I learned everything I know. Now, it’s your time to learn.” My mom stood up and walked back into the kitchen with an air of satisfaction. As if she just completed a milestone in her career of motherhood. Sitting in the chair, I felt more confused than I have in my entire life. I continued to look at the book, but now, instead of feeling eager and curious about the object, I now had an uneasy feeling of dread. I should have destroyed that book right there and then, ripped the pages up into a tiny million eligible pieces, thrown it in the garbage disposal, and let the water take it down the drain so I would never see it again. But I didn’t know. I didn’t have any idea that I would come to loathe that book with every morsel of my soul.
